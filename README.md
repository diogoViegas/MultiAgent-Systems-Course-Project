# MultiAgent-Systems-Course-Project

This repository contains all the code written in the elaboration of the final project of the course of MultiAgent and Autonomous Agents Systems of the MSc program in Computer Science and Engineering at IST (2019/2020).

The project goal was to address a real-world problem recurring to an intelligent system in one of two lines: a) autonomous agents, or b) multi-agent systems.
We created a system that recommends balanced meals for more than one person, depending on the biometric data and the ingredients that one possess. Aside from recommending, our system also encourages food share among the community, thus avoiding food waste.
